# How to Run StudyCoin

# 1) cd into StudyCoin so that in terminal it appears as StudyCoin\StudyCoin
# 2) cd backend
Depending how you download this folder, it should look like studycoin/studycoin/backend before you install all dependencies and run it.
# 3) npm i
This will install all dependencies used in the backend. It will show up as successful when it says running on http://localhost:3001 after running the below command:
# 4) node server.js

# 5) open another terminal and cd frontend
# 6) npm i
Installs all dependencies used on the frontend. Once successful, it will open up in a new tab
# 7) npm start
